        <strong><p>Peer Review Reflection Document:</p></strong>
        <p>
            Being able to discuss and demonstrate the work I have done with other students in the course was extremely beneficial for my learning process.
            From peer reviewing I was able to meet students taking the course who I had previously not spoken to. One of the students who peer reviewed me
            during the semester was majoring in multi-media design course. This was extremely interesting to me as their programming background knowledge
            was limited due to not having to undertake certain programming courses like you have to do when majoring in IT or Computer Science. From reviewing
            this student I was able to see a different perspective on how they underwent and completed tasks. As a result of the peer review experience I personally
            found it better helping a student if they had a coding issue or a certain question than showing and explaining my code.
